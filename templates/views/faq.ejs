                <dd>If you miss the delivery and it gets sent back to us, there will be a $10 to re-ship it. This helps cover a portion of the shipping cost.</dd>

            <div class="faq-block">
                <dt>Gah. I meant to cancel before renewal. Can I get a refund?</dt>
                <dd>If you cancel <span><b>and</b></span> email us requesting a refund before we process it for shipping, then yes. Once we process your order for shipping we *might* be able to refund, but it is not a guarantee.</dd> 
            </div>
            <div class="faq-block">
                <dt>I thought I changed my address, but my subscription still has the wrong address...</dt>

            </div>
            <div class="faq-block">
                <dt>Will the beer I receive be actual homebrew made in a kitchen or garage?</dt>
                <dd>While we think it would be great if we could ship you the real thing straight from our homebrewers’ set ups, selling homebrew is actually illegal. In addition, we would need our homebrewers to brew for several days straight to make enough beer for our membership base, and hand bottling that many beers is just painful. To solve these problems, we work with our homebrewers to scale up their recipes to a commercial level and use a partner brewery to make and bottle the beer we deliver to you. So, in short, you will not receive actual homebrew.</dd>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-block">
                <dt>What do I get with a membership?</dt>
                <dd>You will receive four 22oz. beers from four different homebrewers. You'll learn the homebrewers’ stories, their inspiration behind the beers, and be able to provide feedback through tasting cards located on the website. Members receive discounts on all Noble Brewer beers and merchandise.</dd>
            </div>            
            <div class="faq-block">
                <dt>Are you a brewery?</dt>
                <dd>No, we rely on our partner breweries to produce our homebrewer’s best beers. We focus on finding the best brewers and sharing their story with you.</dd>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-block">
                <dt>How small are your batches?</dt>
                <dd>Each beer we make is a single release and brewed one time. That means we have extremely limited quantities and once we run out of a beer, that's it!</dd>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-block">
                <dt>I really liked one beer in my shipment. Can I order more?</dt>
                <dd>Yes! We hold a small reserve of beers for our members to purchase, while supplies last. If you’d like to order more, login to the site and go to the beers page. Once there you’ll have the ability to purchase each beer individually.</dd>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-block">
                <dt>Where are you located?</dt>
                <dd>We’re a small startup located in Oakland, CA. We have a shop in an industrial park along the Tidal Canal where we get to hang out and eat lunch along the waterfront as the rowing teams go by. Stop in and say ‘Hi’ sometime!</dd>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-block">
                <dt>I’m a homebrewer, what do I need to do to be featured?</dt>
                <dd>We require all of our homebrewers to have won at least one award with their beer. If you've done that, head <a href="http://www.noblebrewer.com/brewersignup">here</a> and apply to be featured!</dd>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-block">
                <dt>What if I'm not happy about my shipment</dt>
                <dd>Ultimately, we want to make sure you enjoy being a member of Noble Brewer and helping us bring homebrewers' beers to life. So if you ever aren't satisfied, let us know and we'll make it up to you!</dd>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-block">
