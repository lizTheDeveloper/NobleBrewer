            <p>Claude Burns</p>
            <p>Claude Burns finished the World Beer Tour, consisting of 100 different beers at Ram’s Head Tavern in Annapolis, MD, shortly after his 21st birthday. He later had the good fortune of living in two of America’s great beer cities– Seattle and San Diego– while serving on active duty. The one constant for him whether he was deployed on an aircraft carrier or working alongside Navy SEALs was his love and passion for exploring new beers. He’s a homebrewer and the founder of Noble Brewer.</p>
            <p>Claude holds a B.S. in Physics from the United States Naval Academy and an MBA from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Feel free to send him an e-mail at claude@NobleBrewerBeer.com.</p>
            <p>Lauralynn Stubler</p>
            <p>Lauralynn’s years in Colorado indoctrinated her into the craft of homebrewing, where her first attempts at batched brews resulted in basement explosions and flying bottle caps. With an admiration for the art of brewing at home, and a passion for helping founders build their companies, she landed in San Francisco where she founded her own eCommerce company, and advises a number of San Francisco startups on all things growth marketing related.</p>
            <p>Lauralynn holds a B.S. in Marketing and a B.S. in Business from Adams State College and graduated from the Tradecraft Growth Hacking program in San Francisco. An entrepreneur herself, she loves to meet other marketers and founders over coffee or happy hour. lauralynn@NobleBrewerBeer.com.</p>

            <p>Cathy Trainor</p>
            <p>After discovering “live beer” on the street in Russia, Cathy thought that she’d never find anything else that she loved. This changed when she moved to Washington D.C. and lived around the corner from an amazing craft beer bar called Meridian Pint and a grocery store where Dogfish Head’s Midas Touch was readily available.</p>
            <p>A graduate from The College of Wooster in Ohio with a B.A. in History, Cathy really enjoys writing about anything from international issues to nerdy beer facts. She finds great joy in building new connections with people and is particularly excited to learn more about the homebrewing community. In her spare time, she is a triathlete and a modern dancer. She is always happy to hear from you at cathy@noblebrewerbeer.com.</p>
