            <p>Homebrewers are creating many outstanding beers that are driving innovation throughout the craft beer industry. However, due to the high capital cost and legal hurdles of starting a brewery many of these artisans are largely unknown and their beers go unshared outside a select few.</p>

            <p>Noble Brewer chooses top homebrewers to feature and partners them with a professional brewery to produce their beer. We then deliver these beers to you along with the story of the homebrewer whose beers you helped bring to life.</p>
