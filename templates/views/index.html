            <div class="body-copy">
              <p>Noble Brewer is a new kind of beer club. We're dedicated to celebrating the pioneers of the the craft beer movement - the homebrewer. We believe a great beer should be savored and appreciated with friends so we focus on creating a tasting experience centered around the origination of the recipe and the people who create them.</p>

            <h3>OUR PROCESS</h3>
            <div class="body-copy">
              <p>Our process starts with the homebrewer. Our community submits their favorite award-winning homebrews. Then, we pair the recipe creator with a professional brewery to make their beer. Once bottled, we ship the beer and the story behind the featured homebrewer to our members who, in turn, provide feedback to the brewers. The end result is unique, one-of-a-kind craft beers that can't be found anywhere else.</p>
